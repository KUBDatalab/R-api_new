In this course we will look at how to extract data from databases using APIs in R. 

We start with the GET method, to get bad dad jokes.

We continue using the POST method which allow more advanced searches. We apply it to the API provided by Statistics Denmark.

Finally the package *danstat* is introduced. This  provides an easier way to interact with Statistics Denmark.
