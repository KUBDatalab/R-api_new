Getting data from databases and other sources on the internet frequently 
requires us to interact with an API (Application Programming Interface). 

This lesson will teach you how to interact with APIs using R.

The lesson builds on previous knowledge about R. If you do not have experience with
R, you will probably not have a good experience following the course. Please
consider taking an introductory course on R before following this course.
