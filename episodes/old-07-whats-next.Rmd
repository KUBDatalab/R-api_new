The goal of this course was to give an introduction on how to work
with API in general.

For many of the major services online, there exists specialized packages
making it easier to work with their API. 

Ideally we would have a complete list here.

Less ambitiously we would have a solid selection.

For now we have one.

The [gargle package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gargle/index.html),
provides tools for working with the Google APIs.


[The Guardian](https://open-platform.theguardian.com/) have an open API providing
access to >2 million articles from that newspaper. You will need to register for
an API key, but it is free.

[Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:REST_API) handles factual data
for the Wikipedia infrastructure.
